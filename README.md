- **Product Detail Page**: Each product has its own detailed page displaying images, descriptions, prices, and availability, providing users with all necessary information to make informed purchasing decisions.

- **Add to Cart**: Users can add products to their shopping cart and manage the quantity of each item, facilitating a smooth shopping process.

- **Checkout with Stripe**: Integration with Stripe ensures secure and efficient payment processing during checkout.

- **Responsive Design**: The platform is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

## Tech Stack
